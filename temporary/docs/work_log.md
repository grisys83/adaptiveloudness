## Phase 11: Acoustic Adaptation Logic Implementation (2024-12-19)

### Task: Advanced Listening Mode Detection
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Priority:** Critical
**Description:** Implemented sophisticated acoustic adaptation system

#### Quiet Mode Logic
**Detection Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Condition 1: 5dB below 1-minute average
const volumeDiff = oneMinuteAverage - currentVolume;
if (volumeDiff >= 5) → trigger

// Condition 2: Absolute threshold
if (currentVolume < -40) → trigger

// Must maintain for 3 seconds
if (quietModeCounter >= 3) → activate
```

**Adaptation Curve:**
- S-curve (sigmoid) function over 2 minutes
- From 100% → 62.5% enhancement
- `adaptation = 1.0 - 0.375 * sigmoid(t/120)`

#### Loud Mode Logic
**Detection Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Condition 1: 10dB above average
if (volumeDiff <= -10) → trigger

// Condition 2: Absolute threshold  
if (currentVolume > -15) → trigger

// Immediate activation (no counter)
```

**Adaptation Curve:**
- S-curve from 0% → user setting
- Protection against over-amplification
- `adaptation = targetAdaptation * sigmoid(t/120)`

#### Recovery Mode
**Activation:** Exit quiet mode to moderate levels (-40 to -15 dB)

**Smart Recovery Logic:**
```javascript
// Only recover if below user default
if (currentAdaptation < targetAdaptation) {
    // Smooth S-curve transition
    adaptation = start + (target - start) * sigmoid(t/120)
}
```

### Task: Mode Transition State Machine

   - Remove top/bottom 20% of samples
   - Eliminates transient spikes

2. **Exponential Moving Average**
   - α = 0.15 (15% new, 85% old)
   - `smoothed = α * new + (1-α) * old`

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Max 1.5 dB/minute change
   - Prevents sudden jumps

### Task: UI Enhancement for Adaptation Display

- Increased min-width to 140px

### Technical Achievement: Headroom Calculation

```
**Display:** Shows actual available headroom in dBFS
